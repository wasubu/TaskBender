I want to make a windows app, It's called taskbender. the UI will look like it's built for Win11. It's a application to add task quickly by pressing a single button. I have a Japanese Layout keyboard so I have keys that I don't use like "muhenko", I would like a feature where I can assign any key or shortcut by pressing it. pressing the custom button will bring up a text field that looks light the spotlight from apple. just a simple textfield to put anything on it. in the text field you can put any task you want and by pressing enter the text field will go away and the task will get added. there is another feature of taskbender called "quicklook", by assigning another key to it, holding it will show you a list of task you built and letting go will make the window disappear hence the quicklook name, holding: show, letting go: disaapear. to access and have more control of the task, there will be a taskbar Icon that you can click, it will lunch the taskbender window. Now what technology will we use? we will not code yet
